Introduce "Copy as cURL" feature to the Network Activity Plugin, enabling developers to easily copy any HTTP request as a cURL command for debugging purposes in terminal. The implementation includes comprehensive support for different request body types (JSON, FormData, binary data) with proper shell escaping, React Native-specific handling for FormData and Blob objects, and content-type inference.
